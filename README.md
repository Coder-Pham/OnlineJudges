# Problem Archive for Online Judges


## Introduction
This reposity is the archive of notable problems (IMHO) that I got to solve on some
online judge platforms.

At the moment, these problems should only be suitable for beginners (CodeForces div3 level).

Difficulty rating is just objective.

I do not want to spoil the Specific Topic for all problems because for some problems, it would be
more interesting (and rewarding) to solve if that piece of info is unknown. Therefore,
spoiler-free tags is used.
